notches from hard wear and long use
holes riddles through it
holes in it for mounting somthing
the gleam of a recent polish
a single rune etched into it
a list of names scratched into it
a crack from top to bottom
fetishes hung from it
a single large gemstone
semiprecious stones set all over it
an empty socket for a very large gemstone
the mark of a particular craftsperson
wear marks from its last owner
the dull sheen of neglect
a network of fine lines covering it
the marks of recent, and shoddy, repair
little of the origional left due to the repairs
bone reinforcement
bringht paint daubed across it
dried blood crusted on it
grime caked in every nook and cranny
gilding, but that was from a long time ago
depictions of eyes
a construction based around a flaw in the original materials
veins of some red material throughout it
deep gauges
a hasty patch job
a chain strung through it
a chain wrapped around it
three bolts that seem to hold it together
the claws of some beast set along its length
