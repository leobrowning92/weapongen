a dim glow
more glimmer than should be possible in this light
no shaddow
runes pulsing faintly
a light humming noise when held
draconian scales that burn to the touch
a gemstone that changes color
the chill of the grave when grasped
a radience that defies shaddow
the ability to suck the brightness out of the room
a vial embeded in it which seems to contain liquid sunlight
two copper rods through it that arc when the weapon is used
a chain which connects it to a petrified heart
